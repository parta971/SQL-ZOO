1. List the teachers who have NULL for their department.

select name
from teacher
where dept is null

2. Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.

select teacher.name,dept.name 
from teacher
inner join dept on dept=dept.id

3. Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed.

select teacher.name,dept.name 
from teacher
left join dept on dept=dept.id

4. Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed.

select teacher.name,dept.name 
from teacher
right join dept on dept=dept.id

5. Show teacher name and mobile number or '07986 444 2266'

select name,coalesce(mobile,'07986 444 2266') as mobile
from teacher

6. Use the COALESCE function and a LEFT JOIN to print the teacher name and department name. Use the string 'None' where there is no department.

select teacher.name,coalesce(dept.name,'None') 
from teacher
left join dept
on dept.id=dept

7. Use COUNT to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones.

select count(name),count(mobile) from teacher

8. Use COUNT and GROUP BY dept.name to show each department and the number of staff. Use a RIGHT JOIN to ensure that the Engineering department is listed.

select dept.name,count(teacher.name) as staff
from teacher
right join dept
on dept.id=dept
group by dept.name
